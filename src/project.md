In this project, you will be building a multi-step form using React . The form will simulate an e-commerce checkout process with multiple steps, allowing users to add or remove items from their cart, enter dummy card details, provide address and delivery information, and display a success page. 

The goal is to practice working with forms in React and implementing data validation. Follow the instructions below to complete the assignment:

1. Set up the project:
    - Create a new React project and a private repo for it on github. Setup and checkout to dev branch
    - Install necessary dependencies like react-router-dom
2. Design the user interface:
    - Create a set of components to represent each step of the checkout process, such as a cart page, card details form, address form, and success page.
    - Use CSS or a styling library to make the app visually appealing and responsive.
    - Ensure that each component is properly connected and can be navigated through within the application.
3. Manage application state:
    - Use React's built-in state management to handle the form data and state changes.
    - Maintain a state for each step of the form, including the cart items, card details, and address information.
    - Handle user input and update the state accordingly, such as storing the selected products and validating user input.
4. Implement the multi-step form:
    - Set up the form steps as separate components and handle their visibility based on the current step.
    - Implement navigation between the different form steps, allowing the user to move forward and backwards through the process.
    - Validate the user's inputs at each step to ensure the required information is provided before proceeding to the next step.
    - Display appropriate error messages if the user enters invalid or incomplete data.
    - Provide buttons or links to navigate between steps and submit the form once all steps are completed.
5. Test and debug:
    - Test your application thoroughly to ensure that each step of the form works as expected.
- Use browser developer tools and console logging to debug any issues that arise.
- Ensure that the user experience is smooth, error-free, and visually consistent across different devices and screen sizes.
6. Optional enhancements:
    - Implement additional features like form validation on individual input fields, real-time feedback, or progress indicators to enhance the user experience.
    - Add loading indicators to simulate asynchronous actions like submitting the form data.
7. Documentation and submission:
    - Write a brief documentation file (readme.md) that explains the functionality and features of your multi-step form application.
    - Include any necessary setup instructions for running the project.
    - Check the submission steps included in this file to submit.

UI Requirements:

- The cart page should display the selected items with options to increase or reduce the quantity.
- The card details form should collect dummy card information like card number, expiration date, and CVV.
- The address form should collect the user's address and delivery information like name, address line, city, and postal code.
- The success page should display a success message or a summary of the completed checkout.

### Submission:

- Create a private repository for the project (ensure you follow git conventions).
- Add me as a collaborator (Ahuoyiza or sophieoyiza@gmail.com
- Integrate Vercel (https://vercel.com/) for deployment.
- Once done, make a pr from your dev branch and assign me as the reviewer.
- Publish/make a post about the project on LinkedIn & Twitter.
- Submit your project using the link below or before 4:00 pm (GMT+1)Friday, July 21, 2023  https://forms.gle/djKSWVY1U3e2xa7FA

Remember to organize your code neatly, use meaningful variable names, and add comments where necessary. Feel free to utilize online resources, tutorials, and official documentation to help you complete this assignment.

Good luck with your assignment! Enjoy building your multi-step form for e-commerce checkout using React!
